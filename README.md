## General info
This project is about creating a simple model which can detect snooker balls and generate a 2D "top-view" of the table, with computer vision methods.
<br />
Using python (NumPy, Matplotlib, openCV ..)

## Description
Takes a static video of a snooker table and detects objects on the table, filters objects to focus on balls, calculates color for each ball and generates a 2D version of the table.
